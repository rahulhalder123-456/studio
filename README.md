# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, you need to configure your Firebase credentials.

1.  **Rename the example file**: In the root of the project, rename the file `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`.
2.  **Add your credentials**: Open the new `.env.local` file and fill in the values from your Firebase project's web app configuration. You can find these in your [Firebase Project Settings](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
3.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

After these steps, your application should be running and connected to your Firebase project.
