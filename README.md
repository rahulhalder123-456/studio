## ðŸ”´ ACTION REQUIRED: Configure API Keys & Security Rules

This app will not run correctly until you configure your API keys and database security rules. These are required manual steps.

### 1. Configure API Keys & Credentials

- In the root of your project, create a new file named `.env.local`.
- Open your new `.env.local` file and add the following lines, pasting your keys after the `=`.
- Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) to generate a free **Google AI API key**.
- Go to your [Firebase Project Settings](https://console.firebase.google.com/) to find your web app's **Firebase credentials**.

```
# Google AI API Key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE

# Firebase Credentials
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=...
```

### 2. Configure Firestore Security Rules

For the app to save data (like projects and user profiles), you MUST update your Firestore Security Rules. The default rules are too restrictive.

- **Go to Firestore Rules**: Open your Firebase project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), navigate to **Build > Firestore Database**, and click the **Rules** tab.
- **Copy & Paste**: A new file named `firestore.rules` has been added to your project. Open this file, copy its entire contents, and paste them into the editor in the Firebase Console, replacing any existing rules.
- **Publish**: Click the **Publish** button.

### 3. Restart the Server

- After updating your `.env.local` file, you **must** stop the development server (Ctrl+C) and restart it (`npm run dev`) for the new credentials to be loaded.
